If you're already up and running with a brick-&amp;-mortar location,you'll want to choose a <span>domain</span> that matches your business name. You've worked hard to create a name and a brand that customers know and love,so you having the matching domain only makes sense for your customers.\"]},{\"items\":[\"Of course, if you have a popular name (like AAA Plumbing), your first choice may not be available. If that's the case,don't worry — there are virtually endless domain variations available. Try a different domain extension like .NET,.BIZ or .CO instead of just .COM. Another tip is to add a local element to your name,such as AAAPlumbingPhoenix.com. This not only differentiates your business from others that may be located across the country,it can help improve your search engine results for local customers.\",\"If you're just starting out — or you're launching a business that will only exist online — choosing your domain name is essentially choosing your company name. You want a name that's memorable and represents your business,if not literally,then at least your company's personality or attitude (think GoDaddy.com).\",\"And all businesses, new and esta"+
